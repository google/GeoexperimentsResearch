## What is this R package for?

This R package ('GeoexperimentsResearch') is an open-source implementation of the geo
experiment analysis methodology developed at Google [1, 2].

This package provides object classes and methods and functions for handling,
verifying, and analyzing data from geo experiments. Version 1.0 implements the
geo experiment methodology presented in [1], also called the geo-based
regression (GBR), and also the follow-up methodology 'time-based regression'
(TBR), introduced in [2].
